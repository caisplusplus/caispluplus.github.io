<strong>February 01, 2023</strong>
<br>
<p>
Swabha Swayamdipta is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in 
the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, where she leads the DILL Lab. Her 
research interests broadly span Natural Language Processing and Machine 
Learning.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, Swayamdipta discusses how debiasing an already-trained model 
is not as effective as relabeling the training data, and how annotator beliefs can 
be associated with their ratings of toxicity of hate speech.

robotics to connect language to the world (RoboNLP). He is interested 
in connecting language to agent perception and action, and lifelong 
learning through interaction.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, Jesse discusses why robots need language and that large
challenges of translating language instructions into agent movement
plans.
