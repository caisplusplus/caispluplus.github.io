        <h2>How can I support AI for social good?</h2>
        <p>The primary method of support for CAIS++ through <a href="/contact/sponsors">sponsorship with the organization</a>.
            However, there are many other non-monetary ways to support CAIS++. Each semester, we present an end of semester
            ShowCAIS to present our most recent work. Learn more about attending ShowCAIS on
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caisplusplus/" target="_blank">our instagram</a>. We are also the student
            branch of the <a href="https://www.cais.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC Center of AI for Social Good (CAIS)</a>, which
            continues to produce innovative research.</p>
