  <article>
    <h4>What is the application timeline?</h4>
    <p>We actively recruit new projects on a rolling basis, though we only start new projects at the beginning of each
      semester. Advisors or clients who wish to partner with us should let us know by <strong>early June for fall projects</strong> and <strong>early October for
      spring projects</strong>.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>How long do projects last?</h4>
    <p>Contingent on the project goals and client availability, we can continue projects across many semesters.
       However, we do not obligate our members to work past a single term.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>How frequent is communication?</h4>
    <p>While our members can take a specific challenge and run with it, we require that our clients
      make themselves available for further contact throughout the course of a project. Regular in-person
      meetings aren’t necessary, but if there is a specific deliverable or the project is especially
      challenging, we recommend <strong>weekly check-ins</strong>.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h4>How can I learn more?</h4>
    <p>Each semester, we present an end of semester
      ShowCAIS to present our most recent work. Learn more about attending ShowCAIS on
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caisplusplus/" target="_blank">our instagram</a>. We are also the student
      branch of the <a href="https://www.cais.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC Center of AI for Social Good (CAIS)</a>, which
      continues to produce innovative research.</p>
