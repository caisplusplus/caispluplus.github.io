                                    <p>Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a rare heart condition that causes inflammation and swelling in blood vessels throughout the body. Diagnosing and treating KD at an early stage is critical, because KD results in life-threatening heart problems for 1 in 5 victims, typically children under the age of 5. Our collaboration with UCSDâs Kawasaki Disease Research Center involves developing an image-based classifier for KD.</p>

                                    <p>Increasing amounts of genetic data are becoming available due to the rise of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, which are revolutionizing the study of evolution, pharmaceuticals, and clinical medicine. NGS data is unique because of its size -- millions of reads in each experiment make it slow to analyze as whole dataset. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an international open-source biological sequence dataset from the NCBI, has uploads which are under-labeled, which poses a problem for researchers mining the genetic data. Our collaboration with USCâs Smith Computational Genomics Lab group involves applying machine learning, probabilistic models, statistics, optimal stopping theory to analyze sequences, label data, and help researchers advance biomedical science.</p>

                                    <p>A CAIS++ team is using ML to create a sample music generation program. When musicians produce music, they often use samples for sounds such as kicks, snares, hi-hats, or even sound effects. The character of a song can be drastically changed by the quality and uniqueness of the sample. Unfortunately, samples are expensive to buy, difficult to record or create, and take up hundreds of gigabytes of space on hard-drives to maintain. We will create a program that takes multiple samples as input and uses them as reference to generate new samples.</p>

                                    <p>Approximately ~60% of the worldâs current 7,000 languages is predicted to go extinct by the end of the century; the death of any language represents an irreversible loss of information across multiple fields, including linguistics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology. A CAIS++ team is continuing their work on developing unsupervised representation learning techniques for automatically extracting and preserving the phonemes of endangered languages. Their focus is on Ladin, a language spoken by about 20,000 people in the Italian Alps, in a research collaboration with USCâs Department of Linguistics.</p>

                                    <p>Homelessness is at a crisis level in Los Angeles, with ~53,000 persons sleeping on the streets or living in emergency shelters every night. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) can only house ~15,000 persons each year. To address this problem, they developed a âpaper and pencilâ approach to housing prioritization and matching, based on peopleâs vulnerability scores, past housing, and history of return to homelessness. Can an ML-based approach out-perform the cityâs current scoring system? In Fall 2019, a CAIS++ team worked with a de-identified dataset of homeless adults to develop ML approaches that identify predictors of housing success.</p>

                                    </h4>

                                    <p>This project comes from the Brain and Creativity Institute and is lead by PhD student Matthew Sachs. His goal is to predict brain activations based on the emotions of a song. Matt collects data by placing each subject in an fMRI scanner and playing them a song, where he records voxel activations in the brain. He also has each subject manually rate how they are feeling on a numerical scale. Matt's focus is on mapping from these behavioral ratings to brain data. However, the scope of this research project is a little broader; anything that helps us better understand the relationship between brain activity and emotional response is fair game. To that end, we have some freedom regarding what we decide to do with the data. We can try mapping from ratings to brain data just like Matt, we can map from acoustic song data to brain data, we can use both as input, or take a different approach entirely. The significance of being able to predict brain data based on some stimuli has wide implications for social good; Matt gave one example of a related project that maps between brain data and reading rates in children. Understanding this connection may allow us to engineer solutions that improve the lives of others, say, by improving how children are taught to read.</p>

                                    <p>In this project, we are trying to speed up the process of language documentation by building a model that produces phonetic transcriptions from audio samples of human languages. The ultimate goal of our project is to develop a model that could be applied to any human language with minimal changes. We will be using around 3-4 hours of partially labeled audio data in an endangered language called Ladin, which we are using as our main training/test data. As of now we have produced some decent results in vowel identifications and are currently working on phoneme segmentation and identification of larger consonant categories.</p>

                                    <p>In 2017, Google came under fire for YouTubeâs machine learning algorithms incorrectly flagging LGBTQ content as âinappropriateâ. This led to an explosion of research in machine learning fairness in pursuit of their goal of âAI for Everyoneâ. In this project, we will first dissect the concept of fairness in a mathematical sense via reading and discussing several recent papers on the topic. Then, we will use Google Colab resources to explore applications of ML fairness and discuss results. Finally, we will read Zhang et al.âs âMitigating Unwanted Biases with Adversarial Learningâ and build our own adversarial GAN to explore the implications of such âdebiasingâ techniques.</p>

                                    <p>Chess is a game of forethought. When making a move, the average grandmaster has the skillset to take into account progressions of up to 20 steps beyond the current board, and many computers can comfortably explore sequences well beyond the 20-move mark. This team will explore a history of chess computing ranging from IBMâs Deep Blue, to Stockfish, which currently has an ELO of 3438 (for reference, Magnus Carlsenâthe current world championâhas a rating of 2954). Our scope will then broaden to look at other game engines to help identify successful ML techniques that have been developed throughout the last few decades. In particular, we will study AlphaGoâs RL implementation in an attempt to help us complete our culminating project: our own chess engine. </p>

                                    <p>This project will utilize NLP to analyze the correlation between Airbnb reviews and gentrification in neighborhoods. In particular, we will attempt to predict crime rates, race/income diversity, house prices, and other similar statistics from Airbnb reviews in a particular geographical region. This is advantageous because it provides a detailed local picture and real time statistics about a neighborhood compared to years old government data. This project builds on a recent Harvard study that used Yelp data to predict economic opportunity in neighborhoods, and can expand to include other consumer based data as well.</p>

                                    <p>This research focuses on the similarities between the human tongue and a humble invertebrate: the worm. Tongues are in fact invertebrate systems in vertebrate organisms, so the comparison is an apt one. By analyzing the movement of the worm, we can classify for the presence of a mutated dopamine gene because dopamine plays an important role in movement signaling. This may one day allow us to detect Parkinsonâs early: by looking at the tongue in the same way.</p>

                                    <p>An integral step to learning how to code is being able to decipher the meaning of a code block. In this project we aim to use pairs of python questions from StackOverflow and code from their accepted answers to try and build a model that will generate an English description given a block of code. This project will begin by building the data set by writing a crawler to grab the code/description pairs from StackOverflow. We will then utilize NLP and GANs/VAEs to decompose code into a latent space, transfer between the code and description latent spaces, and then recompose the description from the latent space. The intended outcome of this project is to roll out a tool to allow beginners to understand what their code is doing, potentially as a website. As with any non-vetted data set, this project is an experiment and may fail. However, it will teach valuable skills across the ML project life cycle, from data gathering to writing testing suites to building the actual models.</p>

Specifically, we are currently talking with researchers at Carnegie Mellon University about obtaining a labeled soundscapes dataset that includes descriptive tags. We will then develop an algorithm that can automatically tag and group soundscapes. We are also currently talking to Mom & Pop Records about a potential collaboration; more info will come soon on this front, but it will involve developing ways to assist A & R tasks. Other projects will include finding ways to analyse and organize sample libraries to help producers search and find samples more efficiently, recognizing when specific sounds occur in a music file in order to assist with music visualizations, and developing a method to âupsampleâ sounds to bring high fidelity to low fidelity sounds.  Lastly, any ideas and projects will be welcomed as well. Music makes everyone happy, so the social good implications of this project are exorbitant. </p>

                                    <p>Pneumonia accounts for over 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years old internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from the disease. While common, accurately diagnosing pneumonia is a tall order. It requires review of a chest radiograph (CXR) by highly trained specialists and confirmation through clinical history, vital signs and laboratory exams. Through deep learning techniques, we hope that we are able to improve both the efficiency and scale of diagnostic services.</p>

                                    <p>With hundreds of languages on the verge of extinction across the world, language documentation is becoming increasingly crucial to the survival of the worldâs cultural diversity. Being one of the earliest and most important stages in documenting languages, producing phonetic transcriptions of audio samples often proves to be the bottleneck due to its time-consuming nature and limited data. By training a recurrent neural network on spoken samples of the Ladin language to segment and label individual phonemes, we aim to automate this process and produce a model that is applicable to most human languages.</p>

                                    </h4>

                                    <p>There seems to be a huge discrepancy between the richness of data that the traditional gold standard for sports betting, Vegas, uses and the data that most machine learning papers written on the topic of NBA games use. For the most part, machine learning/algorithmic predictions of NBA games have used exclusively coarse overview statistics such as team win/loss records and offensive rating (essentially points scored per game). Even though the papers have managed to match or slightly exceed the performance of Vegas, they have done so without even the basic knowledge of which players partake in the game. Therefore, it seems possible that using much finer statistics to try making these predictions could potentially lead to much more accurate results. This project aims to find out whether the prior performance of players appearing in the game could be a better metric to predict the outcome of a game than the team's high level statistics. Using these, we can integrate a much richer understanding of things like which players are having hot streaks and injuries into our model. The project also brings up some interesting questions about machine learning, such as how to handle variable input amounts in non-recurrent models. There may be a reason that current papers have not used fine statistics, but the exercise of trying a different approach to this problem will be enlightening whether it leads to success or not.</p>

Given a range of climate indicators, we will be combining a time series analysis with deep learning techniques to improve upon current predictive models plagued by noise.</p>

                                    <p>Early detection, diagnosis, and prevention of melanoma skin cancer is crucial for patient survival. Far too often, melanoma progresses to advanced stages because patients lack the ability to self-diagnose malignant moles and do not feel the need to consult a dermatologist until it becomes too late. We are using a style transfer algorithm to create a unique dataset of cell-phone quality, labelled, melanoma mole images. Using this data, we will be training a convolutional neural network to predict the likelihood of moles being cancerous, in order to inspire patients to pursue further treatment and medical consultation to reduce the likelihood of fatal melanoma.</p>

                                    <p>Identifying cell nuclei, which hold the cellâs DNA, is the starting point for most disease analysis. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, researchers can understand the underlying biological processes at work. By using deep learning-based image segmentation techniques, we hope to automate the process of identifying nuclei, which will allow for more efficient drug testing, shortening the 10 years it takes for each new drug to come to market.</p>

                                    <h4>LA City Budget: Understanding Civic Spending
                                    </h4>

                                    <p>Every year, the LA budget team manually goes through the yearâs budget appropriations and manually categorizes each budget entry; this categorization makes it easier to aggregate the cityâs spending by category later on. However, since new entries may not perfectly corresponding to existing, pre-categorized budget entries, it takes not only large amounts of work, but also subjective institutional knowledge to correctly categorize each entry. For this reason, many entries simply go uncategorized year-to-year. We are currently working with the LA Mayorâs Office to apply natural language processing techniques to automatically categorize new budget entries, making it understand LAâs annual spending, and to hopefully enable additional insights on how this spending could be improved.</p>

                                    <p>Sporting events are often an emotional rollercoaster, with fans often voicing opinions and reactions on Social Media. Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques such as Sentiment Analysis, our aim is to study sentiment surrounding teams and players, and to see whether any correlation can be found between sentiment, game predictions by fans, and actual game outcomes.</p>

                                    <p>Applying artificial intelligence to create music has been a popular research task for many years. However, recent deep learning approaches have allowed for significant improvement in this domain and have opened many potential avenues for this task. We are working to further explore music creation through the deep learning lense as well as developing methods that use artificial intelligence to assist with the creative process. Current projects include developing algorithms to assist in the creation of jazz heads (sheet music that includes a melody and the corresponding chords) and using Generative Adversarial Networks to develop different styles of drum beats.</p>
